# A C Compiler I'm working on for fun right now

This is supposed to turn into a better version of my distributed programming
language, I will be using llvm for the backend connections and slowly begin
implementing more language features as I go along. Currently working on this
during the end of my days for fun, making good progress. Hopefully I can
bootstrap this thing if it works, although IDK if I really want to reimplement
the entirety of the language again in another langague.
